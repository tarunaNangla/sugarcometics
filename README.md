Hi, I am Taruna. I am in Unit 2 of Masai School.
We (team) are given Unit 2 website as a project.
We have employed HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, and other associated tools to add image icons and fonts to improve functionality and interactivity of our website.
We provided functionality with DOM to the website that we have worked together on this project.
With the help of DSA, we learned how to take input from user, time-complexity analysis, two-pointer sliding technique, and so on.
We were directed to design a project as a team for professional website for Sugar Cosmetics. Our expectation is that this website will be a go-to destination for every individual who wants to buy the latest trends in cosmetics.
