Clone Of Sugar Cosmetic

Hi, I am Taruna. I am in Unit 2.
We are given Unit 2 website as a project.

We have employed HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, and other associated tools to add image icons and fonts to improve functionality and interactivity of our website.
We provided functionality with DOM to the website that we have worked together on this project.
With the help of DSA, we learned how to take input from user, time-complexity analysis, two-pointer sliding technique, and so on.

We were directed to design a project as a team for professional website for Sugar Cosmetics. Our expectation is that this website will be a go-to destination for every individual who wants to buy the latest trends in cosmetics.
We are 5-member team dedicate soley to make Sugar Cosmetic a user-friendly website that brings a considerable amount of traffic by making it as simplistic and interactive as we can for the retail users looking to buy cosmetics online.
Our team members include Puja Kumari, Dipesh Gosh, Gaurav Kumar, Thakur Suraj Bhan Singh, and me (Taruna). I am very happy to work among such wonderful people where I learned and grew a lot over time.
We have completed this project as a team and helped each other debug any problems we encountered along the way.
Everyone has worked to the best of their abilities with dedication to complete this project on time with accuracy.

We were each given a responsibility individually for this project.
Puja Kumari has worked on skincare and homepage.
Dipesh Gosh has worked on brushes section.
Gaurav Kumar has worked on makeup section.
Thakur Suraj Bhan Singh has worked on blog section.

I have contributed to trending section, which includes 3 different pages related to what is most popular among users who visit our page.
I learned how to give functionality to the website and make it more eye-catching to the traffic that visit our page, so we can make it easier for them to come to decision by enlisting our products in a user-friendly manner.
Our goal is to make user experience as friendly as well as interactive as possible to retain maximum possible traffic on our website.
We will continue to streamline and optimize this website that we have created over time to ensure best possible user-experience.
